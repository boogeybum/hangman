// computer picks a random word from an array and displays each character as an underscore

// computer "listens" for the player keystroke input

// computer compares the player input to letters in the word and in the already guessed letters
    // if the letter is included in the word the letter is "revealed" and replaces the "underscore" placeholder and added to the "already guessed" letters list
    // if the letter is NOT included in the word the letter is added to the "already guessed" letters list and reduces the number of wrong letter available guesses by one
    
    // if all letters have been correctly guessed and revealed, update the wins by one and alert "you've won"
    // if wrong letter available guesses value is zero alert "you loose" and update the "losses" by one

// after alert cleared, prompt "play again?"
    // if 'yes', computer picks new random word, resets the number of wrong letter guesses to the default value, clears the "already guessed" letters list
